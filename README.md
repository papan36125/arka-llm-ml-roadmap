# Arka LLM & AI/ML Mastery Roadmap

This repository tracks my end-to-end learning and project journey in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Structure

- `notebooks/` – experiments, tutorials, and exploratory work
- `src/` – reusable Python modules and utilities
- `data/` – raw and processed datasets (ignored from Git)
- `docs/` – notes, exported PDFs, and diagrams
- `experiments/` – logs, metrics, model outputs

## Goals

- Build strong foundations in ML and Deep Learning.
- Understand and implement transformer and LLM architectures.
- Fine-tune and deploy real LLM-based applications.
- Maintain a clean, professional GitHub portfolio for future roles in AI/ML/LLM engineering.
